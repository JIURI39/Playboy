## Instructions

The music and video libraries will scan all media files (including subdirectories) in the library directory.

For music, the `cover.jpg` in the same directory will be used as the cover. Videos will have thumbnails automatically generated by `ffmpeg` (system environment variable needed; Android support is uncertain).

Supported formats: `avi`, `flv`, `mkv`, `mov`, `mp4`, `mpeg`, `webm`, `wmv`, `aac`, `midi`, `mp3`, `ogg`, `wav`

## Cross-Platform Support

### Windows

Requires installation of [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows/desktop?tab=vscode) and [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/zh-hans/downloads/) with C++ workload (or install [VS 2022 Build Tools](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe)).

Example output of `flutter doctor`:

```
Doctor summary (to see all details, run flutter doctor -v):
[✓] Flutter (Channel stable, 3.24.1, on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.22631.4037], locale zh-CN)

[✓] Visual Studio - develop Windows apps (Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 17.11.1)
[✓] Connected device (3 available)
[✓] Network resources
```

Run `flutter build windows` in the project folder to generate the Windows executable.

### Linux

> The current Linux version has some bugs, such as crashes when switching pages during playback and incorrect mini player display size.

Requires installation of [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux) and `libmpv-dev`.

Example output of `flutter doctor`:

```
Doctor summary (to see all details, run flutter doctor -v):

```

Run `flutter build linux` in the project folder to generate the Linux executable.

### macOS

> [It can run](https://github.com/Playboy-Player/Playboy/issues/3), but requires more adaptation work. Development is currently on hold due to lack of a compilation environment.

### Android

> Layout optimization for phones is incomplete; it is recommended to use it on tablet.

Example output of `flutter doctor`:

```
Doctor summary (to see all details, run flutter doctor -v):
